# Enraged Rabbit Project F.A.Q.

Here is the FAQ for the Enraged Rabbit Project.
Check the .md files for each sub part of the project.

### General
**Q: In what material should this be printed with?**  
**A:** The whole design assumes it's printed in ABS. However, several users printed their unit in PLA or PETG, without apparent issues.


**Q: What materials can be printed with the Enraged Rabbit?**  
**A:** So far, PLA, PETG, ABS and TPU were all tested with success. For TPU, both 95A and 30D (~80A) were tested and could be loaded//unloaded using the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder. While the 95A TPU was also working well with the Carrot Patch spool holder + buffer combo, the 30D TPU is way too soft to make filament "loops". If you plan to use such ultra-soft TPU, make sure the concerned Carrot Patch is located in a "clean" area (to avoid your TPU buffer length to be caught on something) or use another buffer//spool holder.


**Q: Can I use this system on another printer than a VORON V2?**  
**A:** Yep, as long as your printer is running Klipper you should be good to go. Make sure the toolhead you are using have a filament sensor below the extruder gear or at the idler itself, like on some MK3 Bear Extruder versions. VORON AfterBurner, Galileo and LGX on AfterBurner are officialy supported, but plenty other toolheads have been modified to fit such a sensor, look in the usermods folder of this repo.


**Q: Can I use a dedicated control board?**  
**A:** Of course, Klipper allows you to use as many MCUs as you want. In the end you'll need to control 2 stepper motors, 1 5V servo, 1 mechanical switch, 1 IR sensor and 1 filament detector. You can find a dedicated PCB, made by @Tircown, here : https://github.com/Tircown/ERCF-easy-brd.
