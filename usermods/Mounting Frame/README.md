# Mounting Frame

Mounting frame for a 6x ERCF Setup - In case you do not have the otherwise necessary 2020 Extrusions at hand.

## Details

Important: The design assumes the two furthest apart lying mounting holes along the length being 198mm in distance ( center to center ) thus you ERCF being in spec.

Comes with a built in ERCF Easy-Brd mounting solution ( shamelessly stolen from the original mount including the print in place supports for it - I suggest importing it as a "part with multiple parts" ). The rear end has a passthrough for Power and Data cables with a built in ZipTie mounting solution. The 6 holes in the Frame need to be populated with the Voron typical M3 Threaded Inserts for the ERCF to be mounted to.

Does now also come with the 3D printed hooks in the photo for attaching it to your Voron 3D Printer - You'll be needing two.

## BOM

- About 75g of Filament using standard Voron print settings.
- 6x M3 Threaded Inserts
- Recommended - 1x ZipTie ( or more depending on your cable management standards )
- Optional - 2x M3x20 Flat Head Countersunk Screws ( or Button Head ones ) for attaching the Frame Hooks to your Voron Frame.
- Optional - 2x M3 2020 Captive Nuts ( for the Frame Hooks )
